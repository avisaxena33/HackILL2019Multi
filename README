Educational Battle Royale
Inspired by the growing popuarity of battle royales, our team decided to put together an educational battle royale-esque game. Relying on the entertaining aspect of games and the intense atmosphere the battle royale genre creates, our project aims to bring a fun factor into studying. Our end goal is to have young kids develop greater math skills through a mix of competition and play. 


Rules
Players begin the game with 100 health points. Once the health points reach 0, the player is eliminated from the game. Players lose health points when they are in the zone. To stay alive, they must solve math questions to accumulate points and stay ahead of the zone. However, the zone expands and damages quicker and harder as time elapses. There will be easy, medium, and hard math questions with each difficulty awarding 3, 5, and 8 points respectively. The last player standing wins.
