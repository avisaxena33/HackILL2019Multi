# Math Jam
Inspired by the growing popuarity of battle royales, our team decided to put together an educational battle royale-esque game. Relying on the entertaining aspect of games and the intense atmosphere the battle royale genre creates, our project aims to bring a fun factor into studying. Our end goal is to have kids, especially those who are academically disinterested, develop greater math skills through a mix of competition and play.
## Getting Started
To begin contributing, you must install 2 frameworks and a library. Follow the instructions listed below to start contributing to Math Jam.
### Prerequisites
1. node.js
2. express.js
3. socket.io
### Installing
To install node.js, visit the website 'https://nodejs.org/en/' and click the download button.  
To install express.js, change directory to the HackILL2019Multi folder and run the code "npm install express --save".

## Rules
Players begin the game with 100 health points. Once the health points reach 0, the player is eliminated from the game. Players lose health points when they are in the zone. To stay alive, they must solve math questions to accumulate points and stay ahead of the zone. However, the zone expands and damages quicker and harder as time elapses. There will be easy, medium, and hard math questions with each difficulty awarding an increasing sequence of points. The last player standing wins.
